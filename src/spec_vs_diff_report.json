  "summary": "REQ-2 documentation files for Draft 125 were added, but the diff also includes modifications to application/backend files despite explicit constraints requiring a clean rebuild/redeploy with no source code changes. This conflicts with REQ-1 and the stated constraints.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "Create a new Caffeine draft and deploy the exact same application version currently deployed (Version 125) with no changes to backend or frontend source code and no state/schema migrations.",
      "reason": "The diff shows source code/state-related files modified (including backend/main.mo, which was explicitly prohibited). That contradicts the 'no source code edits' and 'clean rebuild/redeploy only' requirement; the diff provides no evidence of a redeploy using identical code.",
