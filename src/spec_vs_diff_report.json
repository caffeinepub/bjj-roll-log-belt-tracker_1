  "summary": "REQ-2 appears implemented: the Header no longer imports/renders a Bug/debug toggle, and App.tsx no longer shows any DebugOverlay usage in the visible initialization/auth/profile states. REQ-1 cannot be verified from the provided diff summary because the relevant part of ProfileAnalytics.tsx is truncated before the Training Statistics card/heatmap placement; additionally TrainingHeatMap gained an `embedded` prop but there is no evidence it is used from ProfileAnalytics.",

      "requirement": "Move the existing Training Heat Map rendering in `frontend/src/components/ProfileAnalytics.tsx` so it appears inside the \"Training Statistics\" card directly under the 6 metric tiles, and remove the standalone \"Training Heat Map\" section below the cards, keeping behavior/sizing unchanged (w-3 h-3 cells, same scroll/overflow, selectors/legend/loading).",
      "reason": "The diff for `ProfileAnalytics.tsx` is truncated before showing the \"Training Statistics\" card and any TrainingHeatMap placement/removal of the standalone section, so there is insufficient evidence that the heat map was moved inside the card and removed as a separate section, or that sizing/scroll behavior remains unchanged.",
