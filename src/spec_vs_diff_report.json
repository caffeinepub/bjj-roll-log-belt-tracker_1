  "summary": "The BuildRequest is a promotion-only action (Draft 137 → production) with explicitly no code/schema changes and a post-promotion smoke check. The diff shows multiple repository changes, including a modification to `backend/main.mo` and added frontend markdown files. This conflicts with REQ-1’s “no frontend or backend code changes” constraint, and there is no evidence of an actual smoke check being executed (only checklists/docs were added).",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "Promote the currently deployed draft build (Draft Version 137) to the live (production) canister without introducing additional code or schema changes.",
      "reason": "The diff includes a backend source modification, which violates the requirement that no frontend or backend code changes are introduced as part of the promotion. The diff also does not provide any deployment/promotion artifacts that demonstrate the production canister was updated to match Draft 137 (it only adds documentation placeholders).",
      "evidence": [
        "backend/main.mo (modified)",
        "frontend/DRAFT_137_REDEPLOY_ASSERTION.md (added; includes placeholders “To be filled after deployment”)",

      "reason": "The diff adds smoke-check documentation/checklists but contains no evidence of the smoke check being performed (no recorded results, no automated test/run output, no filled checklist).",
