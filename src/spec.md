# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Expand analytics on the Profile Analytics and Training Log pages from 4 to 6 metrics/visualizations each, derived from existing session and submission-log data.

**Planned changes:**
- Update Profile Analytics (Training Statistics) to show 6 metrics: Total Sessions, Total Training Time (hours), Total Rolls, Submissions Learned (unique submissions at blue belt and above), Favorite Theme, and Average Intensity (mapped consistently to a label), with safe defaults when there are no sessions.
- Update Training Log analytics to show 6 visualizations: Gi vs No-Gi ratio (pie), Session Theme frequency (pie), Average Rolls per Session (time trend), Intensity trends over time (line), Mood vs Intensity correlation (scatter), and Weekly/Monthly Training Volume (bar) supporting both week/month and hours/sessions views, with an empty-state message when there are no sessions.

**User-visible outcome:** Users see expanded, more detailed analytics on their profile and training log, including new metrics and charts that summarize training volume, themes, intensity, mood relationships, and progress at a glance.
