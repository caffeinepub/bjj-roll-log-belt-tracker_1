  "summary": "REQ-1/2/3 are largely implemented via new reusable \"lens-*\" utility classes in global CSS and applied to the header title + desktop profile button and active dashboard tabs. REQ-4 is only partially met: the login button and three feature tiles get lens styling, but the rounded info panel under the login button does not, and an extra (non-requested) lens glow is applied to the entire Welcome card. Additionally, non-visual behavior was changed in the header theme toggle (localStorage/local-first + async backend save), which is outside the requested styling-only scope.",

      "id": "REQ-4",
      "requirement": "Apply the animated Google Lens-style multicolor gradient glow styling to the rounded info panel under the login button (one of the four rounded areas on the welcome page).",
      "reason": "The info panel div under the login button remains `rounded-lg bg-muted/50 p-4` without any `lens-*` class, while other areas received lens styling.",
      "evidence": [
        "frontend/src/components/LoginScreen.tsx (info panel: `<div className=\"rounded-lg bg-muted/50 p-4\">` lacks lens class)"

      "description": "Applied Lens-style surface glow styling to the entire Welcome card (Card wrapper), not just the rounded info panel + three feature tiles requested.",
      "reason": "REQ-4 specifies exactly four rounded areas: the info panel and three feature tiles. The diff adds `lens-surface-glow` to the main Card container (`<Card className=\"border-2 lens-surface-glow\">`), which is an additional area beyond the specified four.",

      ]
    },
    {
      "description": "Changed theme toggle behavior to a local-first implementation that writes to localStorage and asynchronously persists theme preference.",
      "reason": "BuildRequest is limited to visual styling updates only; adding localStorage persistence and changing theme update flow is a functional/behavioral change not requested.",
      "evidence": [
        "frontend/src/components/Header.tsx (`toggleTheme` now calls `localStorage.setItem('bjj-theme', newTheme)` and conditionally `updateThemeMutation.mutate(newTheme)` with comments about local-first/async save)"
