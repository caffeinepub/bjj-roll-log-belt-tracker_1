# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Define and apply the exact final English tooltip copy for the “Submission Proficiency / unique-submissions” tooltip for each belt with correct per-belt targets.

**Planned changes:**
- Set the White Belt tooltip text to: "Unique submissions for White Belt. Target: 5. Counts only on: Blue Belt and higher."
- Set the Blue Belt tooltip text to: "Unique submissions for Blue Belt. Target: 25. Counts only on: Blue Belt and higher."
- Set the Purple Belt tooltip text to: "Unique submissions for Purple Belt. Target: 40. Counts only on: Blue Belt and higher."
- Set the Brown Belt tooltip text to: "Unique submissions for Brown Belt. Target: 60. Counts only on: Blue Belt and higher."
- Set the Black Belt tooltip text to: "Unique submissions for Black Belt. Target: 80. Counts only on: Blue Belt and higher."

**User-visible outcome:** Users see consistent, finalized tooltip text for unique submissions across all belts, with the correct target number displayed per belt.
